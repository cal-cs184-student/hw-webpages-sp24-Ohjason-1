  <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
  
    The project begains with a task of evaluating Bezier curves and surfaces, using De Casteljau's algorithm. This algorithm recursively divides lines connected by control points and creates new lines; it used in computer graphics to model smooth and indefinitely scalable curves and surfaces.
    We had to implement area-weighted vertex normals to enhance phong shading, which looks much smoother than flat shading. We implemented basic mesh operations such as flip edges and split edges to use in loop subdivision.
    Loop subdivision, a method for mesh upsampling, was another key focus. Utilizing split edge method and flip edge method, upsampling method provided great insights into the effects of subdivision on mesh geometry, particularly how pre-splitting edges can influence the symmetry and smoothness of subdivided meshes.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
    De Casteljau's algorithm is a geometric algorithm for evaluating Bezier curves. The algorithm works by linearly interpolating between points to find new points. At each step, it evaluates a new set of points that are calculated with averages of adjacent points with parameter t. This process is repeated until only a single point is left. This algorithm is used in computer graphics to model smooth and indefinitely scalable curves and surfaces. A Bezier curve of degree n is defined by (n + 1) control points. It is a parametic curve with parameter t: [0,1]. 
    A bezier surface of degree (n, m) is defined by (n + 1) x (m + 1) control points. It is a parametic surface based on two parameters u, v ranging from 0 to 1. We work with a vector of 2D points, stored in order. We consider two points at a time, performing interpolation (linear) for some t. Use the vector ‘push_back’ method to insert a point at the end of a vector. 
</p>

<b>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
  We will be working with Std::vector<std::vector<Vector3D> controlPoints. This is a “n x n grid” of original control points. For instance, controlPoints[i] contains n control points at the ith row. First, we consider each row of n control points. We evaluate the bezier function for each row. We then consider the column, performing de casteljau. The rows are parametrized by u, and the columns by v. We repeat this process n times until we get to a single point, P that lies on the bezier surface at the given parameter u and v. 
    To implement this algorithm, we just need to perform the same De Casteljau’s algorithm to reduce all n rows to a point using parameter u. Then, for each of these points in order, perform De Casteljau’s algorithm again to get a single point.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
  The idea is that for a vertex, we use the half-edge data structure to iterate through all faces, not including the boundary face. The normal vector for each face must be weighted by its area. To get the normal for a face, we need to get the three points that define it. We can then perform a cross product to obtain a perpendicular vector. |A x B| = |A||B|sinø, which divides by 2 to get the area of a triangle. Then normal and its magnitude are included by this cross product. 
  In the outer loop, iterate through the triangle’s faces, while skipping boundaries. Then, in an inner loop, we loop through all points associated with the face. If we get the points in order, we perform AB X BC to preserve directionality. Store all of these normal vectors in a ‘vector’ for averaging at the end. Normalize the result.

<b>
    Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
</b>
<p>
  We initially were not creating new vertices correctly, as we were just using the vertextIter() constructor. To fix this, we thought that we needed to explicitly add this to the list of vertices, which caused another whole slew of issues. Eventually we resorted to making an ED post, where I was told that there are newEdge() and newVertex() constructors defined. In the future, we need to read the spec more thoroughly before starting the project. However, drawing a diagram really helped for pointer assignments, so this was not a major issue.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
  <br>First, we want to compute all of the new vertex and old vertex positions. We want to do this first since traversing through the mesh is easier at this phase. Now, the new vertices are computed with 3/8 * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C + D), as mentioned in the spec. The point position is stored in the edge's field, ‘new Position’, since each old edge(excluding the boundary) will be split.</br>
  
  <br>The old vertex’s ‘new Position’ will be computed with the formula: (1 - n * u) * original_position + u * original_neighbor_position_sum, where n is the vertex degree and u is 3/8n(except for when n = 3, u is 3/16). The neighbor sums are from the old positions, not the new positions.</br>
  
  <br>Now, we must split each edge, and flip each edge that is new and connects an old and a new vertex together:</br>

As we perform more and more loop subdivisions, sharp corners and edges seem to be smoother and obtain round edges. If we pre-split certain edges, we can prevent the loop subdivision on that edges.

Since the cube starts with only one crossed edge on each face, each face of the cube is asymmetric. By splitting each crossed edge on the face of the cube, we can make each face symmetric. This action symmetrically subdivides the cube.
